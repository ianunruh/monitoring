# This is a configuration file for apt-cacher-ng, a smart caching proxy for
# software package downloads. It's supposed to be in a directory specified by
# the -c option of apt-cacher-ng, see apt-cacher-ng(8) for details.
#
# NOTE: command line switches and other configuration files matching the same
# file naming scheme (*.conf) can override values from this file.

# Letter case in variable names does not matter, names and values should be
# separated with colons. For boolean variables, zero number is considered false,
# non-zero considered true. If a default value is not explicitly mentioned in
# the description, the commented value assignments mostly represent the default
# values of the particular variables.

# Storage directory for downloaded data and related maintenance activity.
#
CacheDir: /var/cache/apt-cacher-ng

# Log file directory, can be set empty to disable logging
#
LogDir: /var/log/apt-cacher-ng

# A place to look for additional configuration and resource files if they are not
# found in the configuration directory
#
# SupportDir: /usr/lib/apt-cacher-ng

# TCP server port for incoming http (or HTTP proxy) connections.
# Can be set to 9999 to emulate apt-proxy.
#
Port:3142

# Addresses or hostnames to listen on. Multiple addresses must be separated by
# spaces. Each entry must be an exact local address which is associated with a
# local interface. DNS resolution is performed using getaddrinfo(3) for all
# available protocols (IPv4, IPv6, ...). Using a protocol specific format will
# create binding(s) only on protocol specific socket(s), e.g. 0.0.0.0 will
# listen only to IPv4.
#
# Default: listens on all interfaces and protocols
#
# BindAddress: localhost 192.168.7.254 publicNameOnMainInterface
BindAddress: 0.0.0.0

# The specification of another HTTP proxy which shall be used for downloads.

# A bitmask type value declaring the loging verbosity and behavior of the error
# log writing. Non-zero value triggers at least faster log file flushing.
#
# Some higher bits only working with a special debug build of apt-cacher-ng,
# see the manual for details. The setting has an alias named UnbufferLogs.
#
# WARNING: this can write significant amount of data into apt-cacher.err logfile.
#
# Default: 0
#
# Debug:3

# Usually, general purpose proxies like Squid expose the IP address of the
# client user to the remote server using the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header. This
# behaviour can be optionally turned on with the Expose-Origin option.
#
# ExposeOrigin: 0

# When logging the originating IP address, trust the information supplied by
# the client in the X-Forwarded-For header.
#
# LogSubmittedOrigin: 0

# The version string reported to the peer, to be displayed as HTTP client (and
# version) in the logs of the mirror.
#
# WARNING: Expect side effects! Some archives use this header to guess
# capabilities of the client (i.e. allow redirection and/or https links) and
# change their behaviour accordingly but ACNG might not support the expected
# features.
#
# Default: 
#
# UserAgent: Yet Another HTTP Client/1.2.3p4

# In some cases the Import and Expiration tasks might create fresh volatile
# data for internal use by reconstructing them using patch files. This
# by-product might be recompressed with bzip2 and with some luck the resulting
# file becomes identical to the *.bz2 file on the server which can be used by
# APT when requesting a complete version of this file.
# The downside of this feature is higher CPU load on the server during
# the maintenance tasks, and the outcome might have not much value in a LAN
# where all clients update their data often and regularly and therefore usually
# don't need the full version of the index file.
#
# RecompBz2: 0

# Network timeout for outgoing connections, in seconds.
#
# NetworkTimeout: 60

# Sometimes it makes sense to not store the data in cache and just return the
# package data to client while it comes in. The following DontCache* parameters
# can enable this behaviour for certain URL types. The tokens are extended
# regular expressions which the URLs are evaluated against.
#
# DontCacheRequested is applied to the URL as it comes in from the client.
# Example: exclude packages built with kernel-package for x86
# DontCacheRequested: linux-.*_10\...\.Custo._i386
# Example usecase: exclude popular private IP ranges from caching
# DontCacheRequested: 192.168.0 ^10\..* 172.30
#
# DontCacheResolved is applied to URLs after mapping to the target server. If
# multiple backend servers are specified then it's only matched against the
# download link for the FIRST possible source (due to implementation limits).
#
# Example usecase: all Ubuntu stuff comes from a local mirror (specified as
# backend), don't cache it again:
# DontCacheResolved: ubuntumirror.local.net
#
# DontCache directive sets (overrides) both, DontCacheResolved and
# DontCacheRequested.  Provided for convenience, see those directives for
# details.
#
# Example:
# DontCache: .*.local.university.int

# Default permission set of freshly created files and directories, as octal
# numbers (see chmod(1) for details).
# Can by limited by the umask value (see umask(2) for details) if it's set in
# the environment of the starting shell, e.g. in apt-cacher-ng init script or
# in its configuration file.

# DirPerms: 00755

# It's possible to use use apt-cacher-ng as a regular web server with a limited
# feature set, i.e. directory browsing, downloads of any files, Content-Type
# based on /etc/mime.types, but without sorting, CGI execution, index page
# redirection and other funny things.
# To get this behavior, mappings between virtual directories and real
# directories on the server must be defined with the LocalDirs directive.
# Virtual and real directories are separated by spaces, multiple pairs are
# separated by semi-colons. Real directories must be absolute paths.
# NOTE: Since the names of that key directories share the same namespace as
# repository names (see Remap-...) it is administrator's job to avoid conflicts
# between them or explicitly create them.

# Precache a set of files referenced by specified index files. This can be used
# to create a partial mirror usable for offline work. There are certain limits
# and restrictions on the path specification, see manual and the cache control
# web site for details. A list of (maybe) relevant index files could be
# retrieved via "apt-get --print-uris update" on a client machine.
#
# Example:
# PrecacheFor: debrep/dists/unstable/*/source/Sources* debrep/dists/unstable/*/binary-amd64/Packages*

# Arbitrary set of data to append to request headers sent over the wire. Should
# be a well formated HTTP headers part including newlines (DOS style) which 
# can be entered as escape sequences (\r\n).
#
# RequestAppendix: X-Tracking-Choice: do-not-track\r\n

# Specifies the IP protocol families to use for remote connections. Order does
# matter, first specified are considered first. Possible combinations:
# v6 v4
# v4 v6
# v6
# v4
# Default: use native order of the system's TCP/IP stack
#
# ConnectProto: v6 v4

# Regular expiration algorithm finds package files which are no longer listed
# in any index file and removes them of them after a safety period.
# This option allows to keep more versions of a package in the cache after
# safety period is over.
#
# KeepExtraVersions: 1

# Optionally uses TCP access control provided by libwrap, see hosts_access(5)
# for details. Daemon name is apt-cacher-ng.
#
# Default: guessed on startup by looking for explicit mention of apt-cacher-ng
# in /etc/hosts.allow or /etc/hosts.deny files.
#
# UseWrap: 0

# If many machines from the same local network attempt to update index files
# (apt-get update) at nearly the same time, the known state of these index file
# is temporarily frozen and multiple requests receive the cached response
# without contacting the remote server again. This parameter (in seconds)
# specifies the length of this period before these (volatile) files are
# considered outdated.
# Setting this value too low transfers more data and increases remote server
# load, setting this too high (more than a couple of minutes) increases the
# risk of delivering inconsistent responses to the clients.
#
# FreshIndexMaxAge: 27

# Usually the users are not allowed to specify custom TCP ports of remote
# mirrors in the requests, only the default HTTP port can be used (as
# workaround, proxy administrator can create Remap- rules with custom ports).
# This restriction can be disabled by specifying a list of allowed ports or 0
# for any port.
#
# AllowUserPorts: 80

# Normally the HTTP redirection responses are forwarded to the original caller
# (i.e. APT) which starts a new download attempt from the new URL. This
# solution is ok for client configurations with proxy mode but doesn't work
# well with configurations using URL prefixes in sources.list. To work around
# this the server can restart its own download with a redirection URL,
# configured with the following option. The downside is that this might be used
# to circumvent download source policies by malicious users.
# The RedirMax option specifies how many such redirects the server is allowed
# to follow per request, 0 disables the internal redirection.
# Default: guessed on startup, 0 if ForceManaged is used and 5 otherwise.
#
# RedirMax: 5

# There some broken HTTP servers and proxy servers in the wild which don't
# support the If-Range header correctly and return incorrect data when the
# contents of a (volatile) file changed. Setting VfileUseRangeOps to zero
# disables Range-based requests while retrieving volatile files, using
# If-Modified-Since and requesting the complete file instead. Setting it to
# a negative value removes even If-Modified-Since headers.
#
# VfileUseRangeOps: 1

# Allow data pass-through mode for certain hosts when requested by the client
# using a CONNECT request. This is particularly useful to allow access to SSL
# sites (https proxying). The string is a regular expression which should cover
# the server name with port and must be correctly formated and terminated.
# Examples: 
# PassThroughPattern: private-ppa\.launchpad\.net:443$ 
# PassThroughPattern: .* # this would allow CONNECT to everything

# It's possible that an evil client requests a volatile file but does not
# retrieve the response and keeps the connection effectively stuck over
# many hours, blocking the particular file for other download attempts (which
# leads to not reporting file changes on server side to other users). The work
# around is the use of alternative file descriptors inside of apt-cacher-ng,
# however this might cost some extra download traffic due to worse cache usage.
# The ResponseFreezeDetectTime value specifies when a file descriptor in the
# mentioned state is to be considered defect and will require special handling.
# Default time is 500 seconds.
#
# ResponseFreezeDetectTime: 500

# Keep outgoing connections alive and reuse them for later downloads from 
# the same server as long as possible.
#
# ReuseConnections: 1

# Maximum number of requests sent in a batch to remote servers before the first
# response is expected. Using higher values can greatly improve average
# throughput depending on network latency and the implementation of remote
# servers. Makes most sense when also enabled on the client side, see apt.conf
# documentation for details.
#
# Default: 255 if ReuseConnections is set, 1 otherwise
#
# PipelineDepth: 255

# Path to the system directory containing trusted CA certificates used for

# If this value is set to a (positive) number of seconds then the proxy host
# specified by Proxy setting will be ignored if a connection to this host
